# Chicago-food-inspections-2021

This notebook constitutes a research on predictive analytics concerning food inspections in the city of Chicago. It is an analysis of data from previous food inspections with the aim of locating critical violations of the health code. 

The main target, is to investigate whether there was a critical violation in food inspections of each facility. The aforementioned problem lies within the problems of classification as the dependent variable has two values and receives the value of 1 (if there is at least one critical violation) or 0 (if there is no critical violation). 

The software used not only for the data analysis but also for the forecast of the dependent variable was the algorithm XGBoost which was implemented in the Python programming language. XGBoost is an algorithm of machine learning which is based on decision trees and is regarded as one of the most effective modern algorithms in machine learning (especially in Kaggle competitions) because of its speed of execution and its efficiency.
